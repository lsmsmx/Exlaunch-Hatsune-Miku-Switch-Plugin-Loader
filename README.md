# exlaunch
A framework for injecting C/C++ code into Nintendo Switch applications/applet/sysmodules.
Forked specifically for Hatsune Miku Project Diva Megamix!
I plan to port most cool hook based pacthes made for Project Diva Megamix+ for PC to Nintendo Switch, starting with ones from DivaModLoader.
